Hi, I'm Adeeb Salim, welcome to my portfolio! I'm a UCF student graduating with an interdisciplinary studies degree along with a computer science minor, and I'm an aspiring software developer and IT manager. 

Here you'll find information about the projects I've worked on, the skills I have, and learn a bit about me in the process. 
 
I've organized the project pages into software projects and solutions because those are the two main ways to split up the kind of work I do. I like to use software to accomplish tasks, and build solutions to problems using a mix of hardware and software.
