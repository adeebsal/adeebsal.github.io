This is a collection of technology solutions I've implemented in personal and family business projects.

My biggest drive for doing things with technology is the enjoyment I get from solving problems. While code is a big part of solving problems with technology, a sometimes it matters less than the overall implementation. Sometimes it just takes using existing things in new or novel ways or looking at problems from a different perspective.

# Raspberry Pi-powered Menuboard
For the menuboard at my family's restaurant, we needed a solution that was easy to update, cost effective, and looked good. Normally, digital signage solutions are extremely expensive, and result in vendor lock-in where it is hard to transition to different vendors if performance or features is not up to par. However, the Raspberry Pi single board computer retails at only $35, or $50 for a kit including the SD card used as storage and a power adapter. It runs Linux, which is a free and open-source operating system, and can be configured to do almost anything that doesn't involve large amounts of computing power. We used three large TVs as the displays, and since each Raspberry Pi has one display output, used one Pi each. Initially, I set them up manually though Bash scripting and cron jobs to load up an image viewer and display our menu automatically at startup. Doing this setup and having to run them headlessly (as in without display output) outside of displaying the menu taught me a lot about Linux terminal use, system administration, and how the system works on a low level, and how all of that can be used to tackle a real world problem. 
It also taught me the importance of backups. This past year, two of the Pis suffered SD card failures, and the configurations were not properly backed up. They are now instead running Screenly Open Source Edition, a digital signage software solution that simplifies setup, but comes with a host of other issues such as being too heavy for the Pis to run smoothly. However, it provides a stopgap solution while I re-configure the system to a custom one that works better.

# Linux Server, Network, and Cloud Management

This is a fairly recent endeavor for me. I've begun building out a home lab consisting of server nodes (one Dell Micro for now, more to add to the cluster soon) and building out a small-enterprise-class network for the home using Ubiquiti network hardware. Along with this, I have instances on the Amazon Web Services cloud and Oracle Cloud to run microservices on. With these resources, I've been actively learning how to build cloud infrastructure, learn network management principles, implement systems that have automatic failover, and generally learn more about system management. In business, reliability of technology is of utmost importance, especially mission-critical things. I'm learning how to integrate that principle into everything I can and build fail-proof solutions.
