    <p>My understanding of interdisciplinarity honestly hasn&#39;t changed a lot through this course, but has become deeper. In the beginning of the semester I said that to me, interdisciplinarity refers to being able to factor differing perspectives into decisions, learning, and finding solutions. In this course, I have learned that instead of simply factoring in other disciplines, interdisciplinarity means to actually draw from those disciplines to create new meaning and find new insights that wouldn&#39;t be possible otherwise. Simply bridging multiple disciplines to look at a problem from many perspectives toes the line between multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, but creating new meaning makes an endeavor firmly interdisciplinary. I also learned that to correctly bridge disciplines for an interdisciplinary study, one must modify concepts and/or assumptions from disciplines to find common meaning, rather than just looking at the concepts from different disciplines to find common ground.</p>
<p>In my career, I plan to use the skills I&#39;ve learned in this class to solve problems more effectively with the technology I work on. The ultimate goal of any form of technology is to solve a problem or address a need, and an interdisciplinary understanding of the problem will allow me to better fit my projects to solve the problem at hand. </p>
